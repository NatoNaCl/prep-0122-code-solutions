    <p style="color: orange; size: 14;">
      Jango Fett is a really cool Star Wars character as he was a bona fide Mandalorian. Mandalorians were highly skilled fighters whose planet was taken over by the Empire. Jango Fett is a unique Mandalorian as his DNA was cloned to create an army for the Republic, which was also an enemy of the Empire at the time.
